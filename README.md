# Technotes
This contains my personal documentation that I've worked on over the years. Includes various summaries, quickstarts, one liners, and tutorials for various (mostly open source) technologies.

# Disclaimer
I'm not responsible for anything that may occur from this documentation. It may contain all sorts of errors so use at your own risk. Aside from glaring factual errors, I reserve the right to close issues and PRs as I deem fit as the intention is to share my own personal documentation, and not create a wiki.

I tend to create tutorials that uses the tools I use which are Chef, Ubuntu, Docker, and Azure. This doesn't imply support for one technology over the other, but are simply what I happen to use in my day to day. If you get hives looking at documentation that uses these tools, I suggest you look elsewhere.

Examples may reference the fictional [Contoso Corporation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/overview-of-the-contoso-corporation). These references invite you to use your own domain where it makes sense.
